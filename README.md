Solar System Exploration

Due: Thursday 10/23/14 by midnight


Write an OpenGL program that allows users to explore a solar system in their
spaceship. In this game, users fly around space looking for asteroids, planets, moons,
and other objects that you must design (they can be simple, or as complex as you want).
Each object must have a different 3D solid look. You must have more than one object of
each type, e.g. several planets, moons, asteroids, other spaceships, etc., however a single
sun (star) is sufficient. Each object must move around the solar system (planets should
orbit the sun, moons should orbit planets, spaceships should be able to travel in other
paths to anywhere in the solar system). You must implement perspective projection for
the view out of your spaceship. Optionally you may implement other views as well. At
a minimum you must implement the following objects: star, planets, moons, asteroids,
spaceships. You must be able to control the direction and speed of your spaceship.
You are free to implement any other features you wish to make the game more
enjoyable. Are there opponent spaceships that are trying to shoot you, or get in your
way? Be creative!

Follow the coding standards from the course web page. Include with your submission
a write-up of your implementation decisions in a file called readme.txt. Be prepared
to explain your program in class to the other students, and to demo the working
program. Consider adding a computer opponent for extra credit.

The goal of this assignment is to practice animation of objects, and viewing
transforms, so you must describe in detail how you implemented these mechanisms
in the submitted readme.txt file.

(Optional) help screen, splash screen on start-up.

(Optional) collision detection e.g. if spaceship hits a planet, it takes damage/blows
up/etc. Planet/moon/asteroid could break up upon collision as well. Spaceship could
burn up if it comes too close to Sun.

(Optional) gravity, you may have gravity affect the trajectory of your ship.

Follow the coding standards from the course web page. Include with your submission
a write-up of your implementation decisions in a file called readme.txt. Be prepared
to explain your program in class to the other students, and to demo the working
program. Consider what features to add to make the game more visually exciting. The
grading will be the same as last time 10% in-class presentation 40% correctness, 25%
style of coding, 25% coolness factor. Finally, when I type “make” the Makefile should
produce the executable for this assignment, called “space”, note I should not have to
use any argument to make to produce the executable.
