# This sample Makefile allows you to make an OpenGL application
#   whose source is exactly one .c file under linux.
#   check the location of the X libraries on your implementation.
#
# To use this Makefile, you type:
#
#        make xxxx
#                  
# where
#       xxxx.c is the name of the file you wish to compile 
#       
# A binary named xxxx will be produced
# Libraries are assumed to be in the default search paths
# as are any required include files

#
# Modified by Prof. Chelberg to also allow you to make from a single
# c++ source file.  So if xxxx.cc is the sourcefile, you type make
# xxxx to produce the binary file.
